# T.U.G.A.

T.U.G.A. aka. The Underground Adventures is a game we developed in a 30-hour period during GameJam organised by OpenIT.\
We worked in a team of 7 to create this game in Unity using C#.

### Theme
The theme was **"Year 2100"**.\
We made a game in which the main character is in a post-apocalyptic world and must fight zombies to reach the surface and collect food.\
However, there's a twist: the character has been hidden underground for so long that they have begun to imagine the zombies witch are actually people trying to help him. When the character finally emerges from underground, they discover a new and futuristic world that they had been hiding from for decades.

### How to
Fork this repository and pull it, open it in Unity and run it.\
You can play the game with **WSAD**, shoot with **Space** and choose options with **mouse**.
